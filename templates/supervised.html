    <h1>Supervised Learning</h1>
    <p class="p_size_large">Supervised learning is a type of machine learning method in which we provide sample labeled data to the machine learning system in order to train it, and on that basis, it predicts the output.</p>
    <p class="p_size_large">The system creates a model using labeled data to understand the datasets and learn about each data, once the training and processing are done then we test the model by providing a sample data to check whether it is predicting the exact output or not.</p>
    <p class="p_size_large">The goal of supervised learning is to map input data with the output data. The supervised learning is based on supervision, and it is the same as when a student learns things in the supervision of the teacher. The example of supervised learning is <b>spam filtering.</b></p>
    <p class="p_size_large">Supervised learning can be grouped further in two categories of algorithms:</p>
    <ul class="p_size_large">
        <li> <b> <a href="classification"> Classification</a> </b> </li>
        <li> <b> <a href="regression">Regression</a> </b> </li>
    </ul>
